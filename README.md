# DiCo Sales Analysis

This notebook performs an analysis of sales data for DiCo, an online fashion company.

## Data Wrangling

The notebook begins by loading data from four CSV files: customers, orders, products, and sales. 
It then assesses the data quality of each dataframe, identifying issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inaccurate values.
These issues are then addressed by cleaning the data using techniques such as dropping duplicates, imputing missing values, and correcting inaccurate values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook then performs exploratory data analysis to answer several business questions, including:

* How has sales and revenue performed in recent months?
* Which products are the best and worst selling?
* What are the demographics of our customers?
* When was the last time a customer made a transaction?
* How often does a customer make a purchase in recent months?
* How much money do customers spend in recent months?

The EDA involves calculating various metrics and creating visualizations to gain insights into the data.

## Data Visualization

The notebook creates several visualizations to help understand the data, such as:

* Line charts showing sales and revenue trends over time
* Bar charts showing the best and worst performing products
* Bar charts showing customer demographics by gender, age group, and state
* Bar charts showing customer behavior based on RFM analysis

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals several key findings, such as:

* Sales and revenue have been growing steadily over the past year.
* The best-selling products are those with high demand and competitive pricing.
* The customer base is primarily female and concentrated in certain states.
* RFM analysis identifies high-value customers who make frequent purchases and generate significant revenue.

## Conclusion

This notebook provides valuable insights into DiCo's sales data and customer behavior. 
These insights can be used to make informed business decisions and improve the company's performance.
